## About me
I am Brazilian (living in Canada since October 2020) and I am currently a systems analyst at Alta Genetics (CA), working with C# and AngularJS.  
_Fun fact: I worked for the same company for 5 years, but at the Brazil's unit, which I had to leave during the process of moving to Canada._

Since 2007, I work with software development and I have had the opportunity to work with several languages, such as **Java, PHP, Flex, Android and C#**.

Over the last few years, I have been working with Microsoft technologies (SQL Server, C#, Azure DevOps Server), and despite having a good background in backend, I have a passion for frontend.  
In addition to really enjoying UI and UX, I feel comfortable working with javascript/typescript, so I decided to start the year with a new study goal: Node.js and Angular.

### So here is my challenge for 2022

I intend to end this year with a model project, to which I want to apply the following items:

Backend: **Node.js**  
Frontend: **Angular (Angular Material)**  
Database: **SQL** and **NoSQL**  
Environment: **AWS**  
Features: **Authentication/Authorization, offline features, CI, CD, Unit and integrated tests**  
Architecture: **Base on SOLID principles, CQRS**  
Extras: **GeoJSON, I18N**
